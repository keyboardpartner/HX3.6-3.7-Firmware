# HX3.6-3.7-Firmware

### Firmware for KeyboardPartner HX3.6 and HX3.7 boards with ST32F103RET6 or GD32F303RET6 MCU

HX3.6 firmware is compiled with **mikroPascal PRO for ARM** IDE from [**mikroE**](https://www.mikroe.com/). It runs on a ST32F103RET6 or GD32F303RET6 MCU.

### Future repository for HX3.6 Firmware C++ conversion

We plan to port it to PlatformIO IDE with Arduino C++ framework for easier compilation and portability. However, this is a HUGE task.
